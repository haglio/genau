"""Is the VR runtime ready — and if not, can we bring it up ourselves?

GenauVR launches hidden from a shortcut, so a startup that dies on its way to
the headset leaves nothing on screen to read. Asking this question *before*
decoding a clip or opening a window keeps the failure fast and the answer
specific: no runtime at all, a runtime whose headset is off, or ready to render.
