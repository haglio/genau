"""Nau's volume chip: the level it shows, and what a press on it asks for.

The main player's sound is Fun Time's to decide — Nau's mpv is one of two sinks
it drives, Genau's clip audio being the other — so the level here is drawn and
reported, never set.  A press shows the new level at once *and* asks for it at
the same time: the authority's answer is a tick away, and a slider that waited
for it would drag a frame behind the pointer.  The answer overwrites this one
either way, so an ignored press corrects itself rather than sticking.

The geometry is the shared chip's (:mod:`player_core.volume`), placed from the
window's bottom-right corner and riding up with the timeline row beneath it.
This takes window coordinates and does that undoing itself, so nothing above it
holds a second idea of where the chip is.

Lived as two closures inside ``nau.app``'s run loop over a ``nonlocal``.
