"""Nau's keyboard, over the player under it.

A table rather than a chain of comparisons, because a chain is where two
bindings quietly swap: every one of these reached the player through ten
``elif``s inside ``nau.app``'s run loop, where no test could press a key at all.

Ctrl+Q is not in the table.  It is the only binding that reads a modifier, and
it does not act on the player: in a session it asks the session to come down —
see :mod:`nau.dashboard`.
