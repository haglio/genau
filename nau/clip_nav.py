"""Clip navigation: the `clip` metadata Evolver records, and the jumps it powers.

A clip carved out of a compilation gets a sidecar ``clip`` object recording its
parent compilation, its running order within it, and the source movie + performer
it was taken from (see Evolver). This module reads that field and turns it into
the three navigations Fun Time exposes:

* ``compilation`` — the clip's siblings, in original order (for a playlist);
* ``full vid``    — the library video the clip's scene was taken from;
* ``clip jump``  — the reverse, a full scene's clip.

``full vid``/``clip jump`` answer from a ``full_video`` the sidecar records when
one is there: :mod:`nau.clip_match` found the clip's own frames inside that scene,
so it beats any reading of the names. The answer is held against the scene's
*version family* rather than the one file matched, so it survives whichever
version is on screen and hands back the same best-of-family the playlist shows.
Without a recording they fall back to matching the source/performer against the
filename — deliberately loose (token containment) because a library file names
its scene however the user happened to save it, and often enough carries no movie
title at all. Most sources are not in the library, so a miss (``None``) is the
common, expected case either way.
