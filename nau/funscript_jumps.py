"""Getting to the scripted parts, within a video and across the playlist.

The companion to :mod:`nau.clip_jumps`: those moves come from what Evolver
recorded about a clip, these from the funscript paired with it.  Both answer the
same shape of request — take me somewhere better than here — and both report
through the same notice channel, because Nau is the only one that can tell the
request had nowhere to go.

A scripted video is mostly not scripted: a funscript's action comes in runs with
quiet stretches between them (which is why video mode has the Robot Hand fill
those in at all).  "Jump to funscript" skips the stretch you are in; "next funscripted"
gives up on this video and finds one that is scripted, landing on its action
rather than at its top.
