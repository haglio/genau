"""The loop a video is being marked into, or is running in.

:class:`nau.loop_controller.LoopController` is the pure half — where the bounds
go, and which of the three states a gesture leaves the machine in.  This is the
half that has a player: it hands a settled range to mpv, which loops it natively
rather than by seeking, drops the playhead on its start, and clears the range
again when the loop is left.

It lives apart from :class:`nau.session.PlayerSession` because ten of that
class's methods were this and nothing else, while the class's other three
subjects — where the playlist is, how fast and how loud it plays, and who has
the device — never read a loop bound.
