"""The modes Nau is playing in, and what changes them.

Three of them, and they are not the same kind of thing.  The *length mode* is
the library's own filter — mixed, shorts, full — and changing it rebuilds the
playlist.  The *compilation* is a volume's clips standing in for the playlist,
which :mod:`nau.clip_jumps` owns because entering one is what puts you there.
*F-mode* is Fun Time's filter over whichever of those is running, and Nau cannot
see it: the narrowed playlist it receives is indistinguishable from any other,
so the flag has to be said outright for the HUD to be able to show it.

They are gathered here because the console draws them as one line and the mode
memory writes them down as one record, and because the two ways out of a
compilation — naming a length, or leaving without naming one — both need the
length that was feeding the playlist when the volume was entered.

Lived as four closures over two ``nonlocal``s inside ``nau.app``'s run loop.
