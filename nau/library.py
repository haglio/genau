"""Smart library layer for Nau: version grouping, quality dedup, and
length-mode filtering — all pure logic, no pygame or I/O.

Many files in the wild are the same content at different quality or upscale

module folds those variants into a single *version group* keyed on the name —
an upscale is almost always the original's name plus an appended tag — picks
the largest file as the canonical one, and offers a canonical-only shuffle, a
Fun-Time playlist collapse, and a full-length/shorts filter.
