"""Nau's window while the library is being read.

The library walk and the duration probe both run before there is a video, and a
cold duration cache is one ffprobe per unprobed video — long enough that a
double-click with nothing on screen reads as nothing happening.  The window
opens first and this paints the wait into it.

The pure decisions — what the line says, how far the bar has gone, whether this
update is worth a repaint — are module functions so they are unit-testable; the
painting itself needs a real surface and is exercised by running Nau.
