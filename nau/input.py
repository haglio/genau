"""What arrives in Nau's window, and who it is meant for.

SDL hands the frame a queue of events; three things answer them.  The pointer
takes the mouse -- where a press lands, what a drag is dragging, where the
cursor is hovering.  The keyboard takes the keys.  The window being closed is
neither: in a session it is the session that goes, so the gesture is asked of
:mod:`nau.dashboard` rather than answered here.

Nothing is decided in this module beyond WHICH of the three an event belongs
to.  It holds no state of its own -- the hover lives on the pointer, the drag
latch on the console painter, the record-key latch in the keyboard's tables --
so the whole of it is that mapping, and the mapping is where two branches
quietly swap.  It lived inside ``nau.app``'s run loop, where feeding it an
event meant opening a window.

The window size travels with each event rather than being read off the window,
because it is sampled once at the top of the frame: everything in one frame is
answered against one window, even if the window is being resized under it.
