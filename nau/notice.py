"""One-shot notices Nau raises for the Fun Time overlay.

Nau owns the library index, so only Nau can tell that "full video" or "money
shot" had nowhere to go. It has no text layer of its own, and Fun Time already
flashes notices over the main slot — so the result travels as a tiny
sequenced file: Nau bumps the sequence, Fun Time notices the change and flashes
the message once. A missed read just means a missed flash, never a stuck one.

Published whole rather than truncated and rewritten: Fun Time polls this file
several times a second while a run of notices republishes it, and a poller that
catches the empty window cannot tell it from "there is nothing here" -- which is
a notice dropped, or a blank flashed over the video.

        Fun Time reserves for the favorites and the funscripts, so a funscript
        jump says so in the color and an ordinary jump does not.

        The sequence is a wall-clock stamp rather than a counter, so it
        survives a restart: a counter would begin again at 1 while the reader
        still held the high number from the session before, and every notice of
        the new one would read as older than what had already been shown.
