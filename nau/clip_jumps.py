"""The playlist moves a clip's sidecar makes possible.

:mod:`nau.clip_nav` reads the ``clip`` metadata Evolver records and answers
questions about one video; this drives the playlist from those answers, which is
what Fun Time's "compilation" / "full video" / "clip jump" actually do.

Playing a compilation replaces the whole playlist, so it is a place you can be
*stuck* — unlike the other two, which move to one video and leave the playlist
alone.  That is the state Nau's HUD reports, so it lives here, with whatever
puts you in it.
