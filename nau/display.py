"""Whether Nau's window paints, and the black it shows when it does not.

Fun Time's main slot is one rect that Nau and Genau share, and the player
that does not own it is *minimized*, not closed — it keeps its taskbar button
for the whole session.  So an alt-tab or a click on that button restores a
paused player still holding the frame it stopped on.  Genau has been told
DISPLAY_ON/DISPLAY_OFF as it enters and leaves the modes that show it for
exactly this reason; this is Nau's half, and it arrives on the same verbs.

DISPLAY_OFF is not PAUSE.  A paused Nau still has a video up (nau mode pauses
nothing and OmniPause freezes it while it is very much on screen), so blanking
can only key off being told it is off screen.

mpv owns this window's pixels — the video renders straight into it, over the
pygame surface behind — so the black is an opaque overlay composited on top of
the video, the same channel the HUD already rides.  The HUD comes down with the
video: a blanked player shows nothing at all, which is both what "off" means
and why nothing here depends on the order mpv composites overlays in.
