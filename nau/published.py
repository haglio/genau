"""What the room around this player says, kept between frames.

Two files arrive published by somebody else: the console panel Fun Time writes
about the main slot, and the readout Genau writes about what it is doing to the
device.  Both are replaced while this polls them, so a lost race reads a torn
file — and the readers answer None for that, meaning *keep what you have*.
Blanking either for a frame is a visible flicker on a HUD that redraws at 60fps.

Lived as two locals rebound inside ``nau.app``'s run loop, so the rule that keeps
them — the ``or`` on each read — had no test.
