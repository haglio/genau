"""Playback/loop orchestration for Nau, decoupled from the window.

Owns the playlist position, loop recording, seek/step actions, and OSR2
output gating — everything the UI shell and the Fun Time command channel
both drive.  The actual video/audio/timeline is an mpv-backed *player*
(:class:`player_core.mpv_player.MpvPlayer`): mpv hardware-decodes, keeps A/V in sync,
seeks precisely, and loops an A/B range natively, so the session just tells it
what to do and reads its clock back.  Videos without a funscript play
normally: the OSR2 rests at its parked position with no script to follow, and
loop recording falls back to raw clip ranges without funscript snapping.
