"""What Nau draws on top of mpv's video, and in what order.

mpv owns the window and hardware-decodes the video; everything Nau shows is an
overlay bitmap on top of it, updated in place under a stable id.  Four things,
every painted frame: the timeline along the bottom, the console in the top-left
corner, the volume chip above the timeline's right-hand end, and the loop's two
frames above their marks.

The order they are built in carries three rules that nothing outside this module
can see:

* The heatmap's color row is built at the INSET TRACK's width and framed at the
  WINDOW's, so the strip lines up with the plain bar underneath it.  One width
  for the row and another for the frame is not a slip.
* The room's two published files are read before anything drawn believes them,
  and the stroke is read through the gate before the console panel is built out
  of it -- otherwise the pill and the line describe the frame before this one.
* The ids are the Z-ORDER, not the call order: the heatmap is under the loop's
  frames, which are under the console and the chip, which are all under the
  black :mod:`nau.display` puts up when the room takes this slot away.  The
  thumbnails are drawn last and composite second from the bottom.

Lived inline in ``nau.app``'s run loop, where a frame could not be painted
without a window and libmpv, so none of the three had a test.
