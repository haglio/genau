"""What Nau's controls can reach, and every verb that moves one.

Fun Time speaks to this player by writing verbs into ``nau_cmd.txt``, one per
line, which the frame loop drains.  Every one of them has to be able to move the
same handful of things: the session under the window, the length filter and the
compilation it is in, the two kinds of jump, the volume chip, whether this
window paints at all.

Passing those one at a time is what made the dispatcher fifteen parameters wide
and its call site fourteen lines long: thirteen optional callbacks, each with
its own ``is None`` guard inside its own branch, and no way to see from any of
them what the whole control was.  They travel together here instead, built once
where the app is wired and handed whole.

Optional means *this build did not wire it* — a standalone Nau with no
orchestrator, a test that only cares about the session.  A verb whose
collaborator is absent is refused and logged rather than half-acted-on, which is
the behavior :func:`apply_command` documents.
