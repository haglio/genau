"""The channel this player asks Fun Time on, and what it does with no Fun Time.

Every control on Nau's HUD *asks* rather than acts — the console's buttons
because the verbs are the room's, not this player's, and the volume slider
because Fun Time holds the authority over the main slot's sound.  So they all
end up here, on the one file the dashboard's own buttons write to.

Quitting arrives on it too, which is why the gesture lives beside the asks
rather than with the window: in a session, closing this window means quitting
the session, and that is a verb like any other.  See :mod:`player_core.session_quit`
for why.

Lived as two closures inside ``nau.app``'s run loop, where the file was the
argparse namespace's and nothing could reach either one to test it.
