"""What the mouse does to Nau's window.

Four things are under the pointer, and they are asked in this order because each
floats over the one behind it: the console's own buttons at the top left, the
volume chip at the right-hand end of the timeline row, the rest of that row, and
the video everywhere else.

A press that a console button takes never reaches the video; a press on the chip
is never also a press on what is behind it.  A drag is different again — the
console's bands keep a drag that wanders off them, and the volume slider takes
one only along its own track — so a held pointer is offered to whoever grabbed
it rather than to whatever it happens to be over.

Lived as a closure and a chain of event branches inside ``nau.app``'s run loop,
so the one thing it decides — whether a press seeks or pauses — could only be
exercised by opening a window and clicking in it.  Inverting the test, so a click
on the video seeked and a click on the timeline paused, left the whole suite
green.
