"""Funscript activity heatmap: average travel speed per time bucket -> color.

Two steps, kept apart because they fail for different reasons: :func:`bin_speeds`
is arithmetic over the script -- how a segment spanning two bins splits, how one
straddling the window start is clipped -- and :func:`_speed_to_color` is the
palette.  Stated as one function, every arithmetic case had to be written as a
color tuple, so moving a gradient anchor two units turned nine of fourteen tests
red and the failures named the arithmetic rather than the palette.

Pure logic, no pygame: overlay.py owns the drawing.
