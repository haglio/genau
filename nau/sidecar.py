"""Reading the metadata sidecar Evolver keeps beside every library video.

The metadata tree mirrors the video library one-to-one (``…/videos/metadata``
pairs with ``…/videos/videos``), so a video's record sits at the same path under
the metadata root as the video sits under the library root. Evolver owns what
goes in; Nau only reads, and a missing or malformed file is the ordinary case
rather than an error — plenty of videos predate the metadata.
