"""Run loop for a native satellite player: a silent mpv window fun_time drives.

The satellite half of Nau's app shell, stripped to essentials — no funscript,
tcode, heatmap, record or version cycling.  mpv renders the video into a
pygame/SDL window; fun_time positions that window by HWND after launch and drives
playback through the command + paused files, reading back the status file.  The
one thing drawn on top is the lock HUD, composited into the video from the panel
fun_time publishes (see satellite.hud_overlay).

Not unit-tested: it needs the libmpv DLL and a real window.  The pure control
logic it drives lives in satellite.session / satellite.runtime / satellite.hud*,
tested against a fake player.
