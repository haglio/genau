"""Playlist/navigation orchestration for a satellite player, decoupled from the
window.

A satellite is the simple half of Nau: an unscripted, silent looper of short
clips.  It owns its playlist position and drives an mpv-backed *player*
(:class:`nau.mpv_player.MpvPlayer`) to load/pause/lock — but there is no
funscript, no OSR2/T-Code, no loop recording and no audio, so this session is a
fraction of :class:`nau.session.PlayerSession`.  Navigation is fully in-process
(a Python list + index), which is the whole point of leaving VLC behind: no HTTP
playlist to resolve ids against, and pausing is a flag the player obeys.

Auto-advance is the one thing mpv drives itself: the session hands mpv the *next*
clip as a staged playlist entry (``stage_next``), and with prefetch on mpv opens
and decodes it before the current clip ends, then rolls onto it at end-of-file
seamlessly.  Each tick :meth:`advance` notices that roll, re-syncs the index, and
stages the clip after it — so a let-it-play satellite never cold-loads a clip on
screen.  Explicit navigation (next/prev/discard/jump) still cold-loads, which is
fine: those are deliberate gestures, not the every-few-seconds cadence.
