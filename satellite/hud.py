"""The satellite's lock HUD: the panel fun_time publishes, and its geometry.

fun_time owns the *model* — which clips sit on the map, whether the satellite is
locked, which axis is looping — because only fun_time has the library metadata.
It serialises that to a small JSON file per side; this module parses it and lays
it out.  :mod:`satellite.hud_paint` turns the layout into a bitmap mpv
composites into the video, so the HUD has no window and therefore no z-order at
all — it *is* the frame.

Kept free of Pillow so the geometry and hit-testing are unit-testable without a
font: the paint module measures text and hands the width back in.
