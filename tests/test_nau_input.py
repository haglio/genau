"""What arrives in Nau's window, and what it is taken to mean.

The translation itself: which SDL event reaches the pointer, which reaches the
keyboard, and which is the window being closed.  Six branches on ``ev.type``,
two of them gated on the button as well, and until now no test anywhere fed a
pygame event to anything -- so the whole mapping from ``ev.button`` /
``ev.buttons`` / ``ev.pos`` / ``ev.key`` to a collaborator's call was unpinned,
including the two places a wrong index quietly turns a drag into a hover.

What each collaborator then DOES is theirs, and is tested in test_nau_pointer,
test_nau_keys and test_nau_dashboard.
