"""Every key Nau's window answers, against the thing it is supposed to move.

One row per binding, naming the only state that key may change, and the whole
observable state is compared -- so a binding wired to its neighbor's action
fails on the field it should not have touched, not only on the one it missed.
Ten of them reached the player through a chain of comparisons inside the run
loop, and a chain is exactly where two of them quietly swap.
