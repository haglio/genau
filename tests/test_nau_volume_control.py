"""Nau's volume chip: what a press on it shows, and what it asks Fun Time for.

The chip floats at the right-hand end of the timeline row, so every case here
goes through real window coordinates rather than chip-local ones — the offset
from the window's bottom-right corner is half of what a press has to get right,
and a test written in chip-local pixels cannot see the chip move.

800x600 with a 24px timeline row puts the chip at (678, 577); the speaker is its
left 26 columns and the slider the rest.
