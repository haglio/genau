"""What a loop asks of the player, once the state machine has settled it.

`nau.loop_controller` decides where the bounds go; its own tests cover that and
are not repeated here.  These are about the half that has a player: the range
mpv is handed, the playhead landing on its start, the range cleared again, and
the device taken back whenever a loop moves the clock.
