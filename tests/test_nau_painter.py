"""One painted frame: what Nau puts on top of mpv's video, and in what order.

Four things are drawn every frame -- the timeline along the bottom, the console
in the top-left corner, the volume chip above the timeline's right-hand end, and
the loop's two frames above their marks -- and the order they are built in is
load-bearing in ways nothing was watching: the heatmap's colour row is built at
the inset track's width and framed at the window's, the room's two files are
read before anything drawn believes them, and the overlay ids are the z-order
rather than the call order.

The player here is a spy rather than mpv: what reaches it is a list of overlay
calls, which is exactly what a frame is.
