"""Every window icon has to survive having its alpha discarded.

Nau's icon came out of Task Manager as a solid pink square.  The mark was there
— but only in the alpha channel: its 256x256 frame was pink edge to edge, with
the N cut out by transparency alone.  Anything that flattens the image before
drawing it gets the pink rectangle and nothing else, and that is a whole class
of consumer (the task list, small-icon paths, thumbnail extractors), none of
which this repo controls.

The other icons in the family were already drawn the safe way — pink glyph on
black, with the alpha agreeing — which is why only Nau's went wrong, and why the
fix was to make its frames match rather than to chase which consumer dropped the
channel.  The smaller frames of the broken files were fine too, so nothing
caught it: the loaders read a .ico's LARGEST frame, and that was the only one
authored the other way.
