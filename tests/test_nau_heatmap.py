"""The heatmap's two halves, tested as two.

The arithmetic asks how much travel lands in which bin, in units per second.
The palette asks what color a speed is.  Written as one, every arithmetic case
had to be stated as a color tuple, so moving one gradient anchor by two units
turned nine of fourteen tests red and named the arithmetic in every failure.
The palette appears in `TestSpeedToColor` and nowhere else now.
